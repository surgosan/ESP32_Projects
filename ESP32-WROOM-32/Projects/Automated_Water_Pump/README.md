# Automated Water Pump

I began working on this project whenever the water pump for my cat's water fountain began to fail.
At the moment, it is simply using a 12V water pump to pump water. However, it does not stop pumping
water which is a waste of energy.

Thus, I began working on this project to save energy by turning off the water pump at night when everyone
is asleep. I also want to be able to control it from my phone, so I can turn it off or on if needed.
