# Automated Water Pump

![Main Image][7]


I began working on this project whenever the water pump for my cat's water fountain began to fail.
At the moment, it is simply using a 12V water pump to pump water. However, it does not stop pumping
water which is a waste of energy.

Thus, I began working on this project to save energy by turning off the water pump at night when everyone
is asleep. I also want to be able to control it from my phone, so I can turn it off or on if needed.

## Parts

- ESP32-WROOM-2
- Proto-Board
- 3d Printed Enclosure
- 12V Power Supply
- Buck Converter (LM2596)
- Solid Core 20 Gauge Wire
- Screw Terminal Blocks
- Barrel Power Adapter
- MOSFET Driver
- 10 kOhm Resistor
- 1000uf 16V Capacitor

## Process

I started by creating a prototype of the device. I used a full sized breadboard to house everything,
but I will be reducing it to half a breadboard. This allowed me to more easily test the circuits to 
ensure that the project works as intended.
